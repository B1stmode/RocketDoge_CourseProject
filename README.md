# 🚀 Rocket Dodge

Rocket Dodge is a precision-based physics game built in Unity, where control, timing, and momentum determine whether you escape — or crash underground.

The project was created as part of a Unity course and later expanded with additional systems, polish, and gameplay improvements.

## 🎮 What is Rocket Dodge?

You pilot a **small evacuation rocket** trapped at the lowest level of a **man-made cave system** on a moon.  
A failed deep-drilling operation has destabilized the entire structure — and the only way out is **up**.

Each cave layer is a self-contained level.  
Survive it, reach the checkpoint platform, and ascend closer to the surface.

There is no combat.  
There is no safety net.  
Just physics, precision, and increasingly hostile terrain.

## 🔁 Core Gameplay Loop

- Navigate tight cave spaces using **rotation + thrust**
- Dodge moving mechanical obstacles (pistons, pipes)
- Avoid static hazards (collapsed rock, debris, structural supports)
- Reach a landing pad checkpoint at the end of each level
- Automatically transition to the next cave layer
- Difficulty increases through:
  - Obstacle density
  - Placement precision
  - Timing pressure
- Final level exits the cave system onto the surface

## 🎛 Controls

- **Rotation:** ← / → or A / D  
- **Thrust:** Space or W  

Controls are intentionally **tight and unforgiving**.  
Mistakes are on the player — not the game.

## 🛠 Technical Overview

- **Engine:** Unity 6.1
- **Perspective:** 3D environment with 2D movement plane
- **Art Style:** Low-poly, modular assets
- Physics-driven movement
- Progressive difficulty scaling

## 📚 What Came From the Course

- Basic player controller (arrow keys + space)
- Core 3D assets and models
- Sound effects and basic FX
- Fundamental level structure

---

## ✨ What I Added Extra

- Alternative control scheme (W / A / D)
- Death counter
- Main menu with settings and level selection
- Additional levels
- End-game scene with credits
- Post-processing improvements
- Pause menu

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Thinking in **systems and logic** instead of raw syntax
- Breaking complex problems into smaller, solvable parts
- Translating gameplay ideas into code structure
- Working effectively with Unity Editor tools and workflows

Rocket Dodge was a turning-point project where I stopped copying code and started thinking like a developer.

## 🔗 Course Reference

This project was originally started as part of the following Unity course:

- **Unity Complete 3D Course** – GameDev.tv  
  [https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/unity-complete-3d](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/?couponCode=ACCAGE0923)

All course-provided content was later extended and modified with my own logic, features, and gameplay changes.
